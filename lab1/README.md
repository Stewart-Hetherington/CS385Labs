Lab Task:

Create a very simple and plain three course menu selector application (single
HTML page) using HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript. The HTML page should have
three food choice buttons: “Starters”, “Mains” and “Deserts”. When one of these
buttons are clicked then the Javascript code will randomly select from the
corresponding array of sample course items. For example if we click on the
“Mains” button our Javascript code should randomly select a main course
option from an appropriately designed Javascript array and subsequently print
this to the HTML page (under or beside the corresponding button). You should
use a DIV component as the target for this printing.
The HTML page should also have a button called “Start Over” which resets all of
the choices for Starters, Mains and Deserts. To demonstrate the proper working
of this application each course (starter, main and desert) should have at least 5
elements in the corresponding array.
An example of the user-interface of this HTML page is shown below. If you are
already familiar with HTML and Bootstrap you are free to enhance the userinterface.
If you are just starting HTML, Javascript etc – it is most important to get
the functionality working rather than the overall ‘look-and-feel’ of the HTML
page.
